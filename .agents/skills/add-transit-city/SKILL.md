# Add a new transit city

The app is region-agnostic: it renders and filters whatever is in
`src/data/stations.json`. Adding a city = producing that file for the new region
and adjusting a few region constants. There is no per-city code branching.

## Steps

1. **Gather station sources** for the new region (the same kinds the Bay Area
   uses): rail/metro GTFS `stops.txt` for fixed-station systems, and OSM line
   relations (Overpass) for tram/light-rail/streetcar systems where you want
   every stop. See `scripts/overpass.py` for the Overpass query pattern.

2. **Adapt `scripts/build_stations.py`** to the new systems:
   - Replace the BART/Caltrain/VTA/Muni loaders with the new systems.
   - Keep the dedup logic: within-system clustering (identical name any distance,
     else nearest `< 150 m`) and cross-system merge (`< 200 m`, different systems
     only, OR-ing service flags). Tune thresholds for the city's stop spacing.
   - Keep the name-collision disambiguation (append system).
   - Encode each system's service: frequent systems use the `FREQUENT` constant;
     systems with sparse/peak service need a per-stop `{served, hourly}` per day
     like `caltrain_service.json`.

3. **Update region constants in `scripts/build_attributes.py`**:
   - `AIRPORTS` → the new region's commercial airports (name → lat/lon).
   - County/city come from the **US Census** geocoder, which is **US-only**. For
     non-US regions, swap `census_geo` for a different admin-boundary source
     (e.g. OSM Nominatim reverse geocoding or a local boundary shapefile) and
     keep the returned `county`/`city` shape. Elevation via USGS EPQS is also
     US-only — use a global DEM/elevation API outside the US.

4. **Run the pipeline** (see the `rebuild-station-dataset` skill) and verify the
   enriched `src/data/stations.json` has every field in the `Station` type.

5. **Update the map default view** in `src/components/MapView.tsx` (initial
   center/zoom) to the new region, and update copy in `src/App.tsx`, `README.md`,
   `STATIONS.md`, and `public/stations-map.html`.

6. **Question set**: the existing medium-game questions in `src/data/questions.ts`
   are geography-generic and need no change. If the new region lacks an attribute
   a question relies on (e.g. no airports), hide that question or ensure the
   attribute is still populated.

## Multi-region (optional)
If you want one deployment to switch between cities, generalize
`src/data/stations.json` into `src/data/<region>.json` files plus a region
picker that selects which JSON to load and which map center to use. Keep each
region file the exact same `Station[]` shape so the elimination engine is
untouched.

## Verify
`npm run lint && npx tsc -b --noEmit && npm run build`, then `npm run dev` and
confirm the new region renders and the toggles/filters behave.
